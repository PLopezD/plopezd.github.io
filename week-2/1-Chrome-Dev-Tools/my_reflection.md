* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

DOM is a tool that allows you to see visually how changing the code behind objects and immidetly see the effect. DOM allows you to see a clear tree of the HTML and its corresponding code. It is a great way to visually see what is effecting HTML/XML and manipulate it.

Wordpress.com sites have a lot more code behind them, which seems obvious since they are far more advanced than mine. It was good to see different ways I can manipulate objects in my code going forward. 

Chrome web tools is incredibly useful and a lot of fun. I will be using it heavily going forward.

Chrome web tools helped me develop a drop down menu for my index.html, that was an "aha" moment.
