# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that having aesthetically pleasing front-end  development is necessary to keep users coming back to your site. If a user thinks your site is cold or slow they will not want to use your service no matter how good it is.


Design is a lot of fun and allows for a lot of creativity. My issue is that is can be very time consuming for incrementally minimal gain. While a fellow developer will see a certain attribute and think it is great, the general public may not notice such tiny events. It is important to say "enough is enough" at a certian point.


My process required a lot of looking at other pages for ideas and then trying to implement those ideas on my page through trial and error. I felt it worked well but was incredibly time consuming for minimal gain.


I need to fix my "drop-up" so it works when I add more lines to the list without having to manually fix the height. I need to make the css adaptive/dynamic. I also would like to optimize the site, right now the background picture takes a long time to load. Finally the header of my site is unnappealing, I will fix that.

I found a lot of pre-built CSS out there that looks beautiful. Currently we are not allowed to use that code though so trying to apply some of that was difficult.
