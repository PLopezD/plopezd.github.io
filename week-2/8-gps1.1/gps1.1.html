  <div class="head"><h1> Pair Programming Review <br> By: Pablo & Wesley</h1></div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>One of the best aspects of peer programming is having an extra sets of eyes to look at your work. Personally, I hit a lot of very frustrating walls during our Week 1 challenges, and I know that if I had someone else to take a look, the challenges would have been easier to overcome. Pair programming can benefit both partners in the fact that it is a safety net for their code. They say that two heads are better than one, and already with our first peer challenge, we can see why.</p>

    <p>Peer programming allows for users to bring a social aspect into the work they are doing. 
      Very rarely in the workplace will you find yourself working on a project alone, typically
      many great minds have to come together to accomplish a goal. Peer programming gives us a window
      into what it is like to work with a group in a professional environment.

      <ul>
        <li>Driver</li>
          <ol>
            <li>A person who writes the hard code.</li>
            <li>This person typically is dealing with the specifics and syntax of the program.</li>
            <li>They provide a rough draft of the project.</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Navigator</li>
          <ol>
            <li>This person might usually guide the code.</li>
            <li>It is typical for them to oversee the writing process.</li>
            <li>They act as an editor to the final product.</li>
          </ol>
      </ul>
     <p> For our first pair, we feel like it went very well. We switched on and off being both driver and navigator, since we both had the ability to alter our code. We both had a similar working style, so it was easy for us to complete our challenge in time. There were really no issues working with eachother. We both had a sound understanding of HTML and there was no problem reaching the requirements of our challenge.</p>
