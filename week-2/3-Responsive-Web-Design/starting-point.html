      Responsive web design term is related to the concept of developing a website design in a manner that helps the lay out to get changed according to the computer screen resolution of the user. Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience. This means easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a wide range of devices from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors.

      <h1 class="section-titles">Fluid Layouts</h1>
      For fluid layouts, dimensions are defined in percentages, and as you might expect, this affords greater malleability and fluidity. In other words, by setting a percentage, you will not have to think about device size or screen width, and consequently, you can find a reasonable solution for each case because the sizing of your design will adapt to the size of the device used. Fluid layouts are closely linked to media queries and special styles for optimization. Percentage based widths alone will likely not be enough to accommodate your design for a large variety of display sizes. The display on mobile devices can be especially difficult to implement using fluid design practices.

      Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
      You don't need to keep these questions visible.

        <li>Implementing these concepts were fairly easy, they required some syntax tweaks for our specific web page. 
This allowed us to learn exactly how the rules work, it was a worthwhile process.

Smartphones and tablets have forced developers to expand their craft. While it requires more work to get a website to adapt to different platforms it also makes your site accessible to more people so your work can effect more people. I think in the near future websites will have to be three dimensional and that will require another scripting process.

Alt text allows certain applications to read websites out loud so visually impaired people can use them. 
Yes, we need to design for the use of everyone. 

I believe building an attractive website is key to accomplishing most goals on the internet. While in some cases an unattractive site may be fine for certain markets. Generally, people like to be visually stimulated by the tools they are using. When we cater to that need we build trust from our users.</li>
