      Responsive web design term is related to the concept of developing a website design in a manner that helps the lay out to get changed according to the computer screen resolution of the user. Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience. This means easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling across a wide range of devices from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors.

      <h1 class="section-titles">Fluid Layouts</h1>
      For fluid layouts, dimensions are defined in percentages, and as you might expect, this affords greater malleability and fluidity. In other words, by setting a percentage, you will not have to think about device size or screen width, and consequently, you can find a reasonable solution for each case because the sizing of your design will adapt to the size of the device used. Fluid layouts are closely linked to media queries and special styles for optimization. Percentage based widths alone will likely not be enough to accommodate your design for a large variety of display sizes. The display on mobile devices can be especially difficult to implement using fluid design practices.
