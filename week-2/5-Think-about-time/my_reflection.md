# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

Thus far my biggest challenge has been finding the time between working 60 hours a week and being social. Some sacrifices will have to be made over the next few weeks. Since I am quitting my job and moving to another state to do DBC I don't feel this will translate into the program. While I am in this situation I will just have to deal with a bit less sleep for a while :P

I will try the pomodoro technique as well.

Currently the plan is to quit at the week 5 mark which will allow a lot more time for DBC phase 0.
Then I will go back and spend many more hours re-hashing weeks 1-4.
