# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are good. They allow you to get your content to more users.

Yes, standard structure allows us to reach across many older platforms which will mean people need to upgrade computers less often.  Saving on computer upgrades has great economic benefits :)

Yes, it simplifies writing code. It almost makes it much easier to follow other developer's code.

The reset.css allows us to shrink the size of certain documents which allows them to load faster and requires less resources. It allows us to be backwards compatible on many browsers as well.

I use google chrome and windows explorer 9. On windows explorer typically things just take longer to load for whatever reason.
