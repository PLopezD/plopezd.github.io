## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


HTML seems logical. It provides the content, CSS provides the aesthetics. 

The only con to HTML is that is relies on another file to be beautified. If there was a simple way to do this in just HTML rather than having to link to CSS that would be ideal. That said, it would lead to a large, clunky, unattractive file. 

I ran into some painful github upload moments which were not allowing me to refresh which were infuriating. Getting past that was an aha moment which got me motivated to continue.
