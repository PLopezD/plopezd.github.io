I used W3schools.com very often during this exercise. Their site does a good job of showing you clearly how certain CSS functions work. I found myself asking what the different color # combos were as well as needing a refresher on how to make a border, etc. 

The float concept doesn't work as well as I would have thought so I am not sure if I did it incorrectly or if something else was pushing against it which didn't allow it to function. Also my spacial reasoning in terms of knowing how many pixels go across a screen, etc could use work. I use a 27 inch monitor so I imagine sites that come up nicely on my computer may look distorted on others. 

I learned how to properly write text over an object, that was exciting and seems useful.

I am confident that with time I can fiddle through most any problem in CSS. Unfortuntely my time management this week was sub par and I didn't allow myself the time I would like to make things look better. This will not be a problem in the weeks going forward.

I enjoyed filling out the content, I enjoyed fiddling with pixels until I was comfortable with how things looked(never truly got comfortable but I reached a point where I felt I had committed enough time)

I find making .css files a bit tedious since there are so many templates already out there that look stunning. That said, I also understand the value of practicing basics.
