## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


+To create a repository you go to https://github.com/new, select a name, enter a description, select if you would like it to be public or private and select whether a license should be added to your repo. It can be cloned to your local computer by using the git clone command followed by the link to the repo found in the lower right corner of the repo page. It is labeled "HTTPS" or "SSH" clone URL.
 +
 +Open source means allowing access to the underlying code of a website/app to anyone who wants it. This allows people to manipulate the code and help it grow/improve. 
 +
 +My feelings towards open source depend on the project I am working on. If my goal is to make a profit and eliminate competitors I would not use open source for my product. If my goal is to help the community and allow others to adapt my product to their needs then I feel comfortable allowing others to use my code. It can also be valuable in a business sense in terms of collecting free labor. Basically I support it and will use it depending on my product.
 +
 +Licenses allow users to protect themselves from others stealing code. They also assure credit is given to the original creators of a code. I beleive they are necessary on all projects. 
 +
 +Understanding the different types of licenses and how to apply them was solidified.
