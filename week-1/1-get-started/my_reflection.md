## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Setting up github and git were fairly straight forward, I had some experience with these before. 
Git is a local(offline) version of github. Git allows you to save versions of your work so you can write different code without messing up prior versions  that worked well. When you write new code you create a branch which is a copy of the original file with changes. The branch does not overwrite the original file until you tell it to by writing the "git init" command. Github allows you to do this online so you can work with others on the same file without corrupting functional code or overwriting each others code. 
Version control is the practice of saving several versions of a file so as to not corrupt functional code. Github lets many people from different places work on the same file until eveyrone is satisfied then merges them into the live file.
Developers use version control to make collaboration of files easier. This makes perfect sense and makes large projects which require large teams and many different area of code much much easier.
