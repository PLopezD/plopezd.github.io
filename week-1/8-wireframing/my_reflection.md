## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I learned that you need to have an attractive site to sell your product. You need to be appealing to your customer if they are going to buy what you are selling.

Design is a crucial part of  the sales. Now that I have a better understanding of this, I wish I had gussied up my solo challenge a bit more. 

Conceptually it all seems to make sense, I feel a design course in the future would come in handy even if I plan on working on back end projects. 

I am very confident that I have absorbed all the learning competencies for this challenge.

The making of the wireframe was very entertaining, some of the readings were tedious/repetative.
