I learned what the domain name system is. I learned that 1200 servers can fit in one server unit and that overheating is a serious problem with server maintenance.

It is important to have nameservers that are most relevent to your area. You can adjust which nameservers you want to use at your hosting company website/app. It is also important to be aware, based on the goals of your project, whether you need to build a website or a web application.

I was excited to see my website go live. 

When my git pushed to my github was an aha moment which took a lot of fiddling to accomplish but I now feel i have a good understanding of how to do it.
