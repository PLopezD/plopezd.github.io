## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: plopezd.github.io

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?



I enjoyed this, It helped me get my bearings and I feel I did a better job with it than the solo challenge. I still don't think writing CSS is a wise use of time but I understand how being able to debug by doing these projects may prove useful down the line. I made a table for my page which I am proud of, I also made my images into links which I didn't know how to do before this. Overall this was surely a benefit.
