<p id="p1"> We are learning how to write html today. I hope to have an eye opening experience. Content production is an important part of the social experience. </p>

<p> We must also focus on QUALITY content production. Anyone can create a list of their favorite tanning oils. This, however, serves no practical value to the world.</p>

<p>So far sublime has been a very appealing text editor. This is an example of producing a <br> quality product as opposed to regular microsoft notepad. That said, notepad was quite an exciting product for many in its <br> day. It does not appear as though sublime has an ipad app. Perhaps that is a space they could consider moving into.</p>
