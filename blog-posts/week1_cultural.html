    <td> <h3>Quora is an amazing source for knowledge on many aspects of life. It brings together a wide array of 
           seemingly above average intelligence into one place. Topics are proposed and discussed and debated in great 
           length. I have seen it compared to reddit but without the random memes and pointless, though sometimes 
           entertaining, content. This can partly be attributed to having to register with your real name rather than a pseudoname.
           Visually the site is very clean or plain. Just a search bar and a main panel of scrolling topics. Quora has 
           become an great place for me to be entertained while not feeling like I have wasted time. I always feel like
           I am learning on this site. The plain layout allows for ease of use for hours without feeling worn out.

    <td><h3>Pando daily is a leading source for breaking tech news. It serves the same purpose as techcrunch & recode but 
    I feel its writers are a bit more analytical than the others. The site is fairly attractive using large, caricaturesk 
    illustrations to draw readers into clicking links. They recently went through a website re-design which has left some
    unattractive white space along the margins but all in all the site is clean and pleasing. The site is easy to browse 
    and content is only updated when there is something to write about as opposed to other news sites which can just churn out 
    frivilous articles to keep people coming back.

    <td><h3> Reuters is a strong source for hard business and world news. It reports quickly and updates often on 
    any type of disaster or unfolding stories. Though the site is a bit cluttered it has fewer advertisements than many 
    other news sites and it has a easy enough navigation bar.
    I have seen their videos start with long ads which can be off putting. Though cluttered is has a clean, contrasted look.
    It uses provacative images to grab attention. It also has a stock ticker function which can be customised to follow your
    stocks, an appealing feature for some.
