    <td> <h3>DBC seems like it will be a very eye opening experience. I am excited to meet new people and to adapt
    to each others learning styles. I anticipate an enlightening experience. Anytime in my career where people from 
    different backgrounds have collaborated on a project the results have been great. The thought of an entire course 
    dedicated towards doing that seems like a good opportunity to grow/absorb. <br>
    
    That said I am also slightly nervous. There are times where in a group environment stubborn people very much 
    ruin the fun or flat out decrease efficiency of a group. Pairing with these people may lead to some sub optimal situations.
    But perhaps it is the job of each student to adapt to their peers.
