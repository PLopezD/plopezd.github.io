    <td> <h3>Quora is an amazing source for knowledge on many aspects of life. It brings together a wide array of 
           seemingly above average intelligence into one place. Topics are proposed and discussed and debated in great length.
           I have seen it compared to reddit but without the random memes and pointless, though sometimes entertaining, 
           content. This can partly be attributed to having to register with your real name rather than a pseudoname.<br>
           Visually the site is very clean or plain. Just a search bar and a main panel of scrolling topics. Quora has 
           become an great place for me to be entertained while not feeling like I have wasted time. I always feel like
           I am learning on this site. The plain layout allows for ease of use for hours without feeling worn out.
