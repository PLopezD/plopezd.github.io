#U3.W8-9: Create your Own Database

## Learning Competencies
- Adhere to established naming conventions for DB tables and columns
- Create a graphical representation of a simple database
- Identify database relationships including one to many, many to many, and one to one
- Write simple SELECT statements to extract data from one or more fields on a single table using the SELECT, FROM, WHERE, LIMIT, and ORDER BY keywords

## Summary:
I'm sure you have something you would like to itemize into a database. In this challenge, you will want to explore designing, implementing, and searching a database you create.

## Release 0: Decide what you want to track
Come up with something that needs at least 2 tables.

## Release 1: Design the Schema
Using [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql), create a schema for your database.

Take a screenshot. Upload it to this directory, and display it inline in the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file.

## Release 2: Add the schemas
Follow the instructions from [4 Intro to SQLite](../../../week-7/4-intro-to-SQLite) to set up your database.

## Release 3: Connect your tables
Research connecting your tables to one another using foreign keys.

## Release 4: Enter Data
Enter some data for one of the tables. Make at least 10 entries.

Copy your terminal output and put it in the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file.

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)
Put your reflection in the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file.

## Release 6: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/review.md)
